// možda redis caching za česte upite ka bazi?? za sada

// jebote
// dodati cache prefetching npr za pošte i common loaded podatke??
// gde da turim jebeni pub sub???????

//Integrating Redis into your Blazor .NET app for post/courier/package sending functionalities can offer several benefits,
//primarily in improving performance, scalability, and caching capabilities. Here are some areas where you could consider
//implementing Redis:

//Caching:
//Redis can be used to cache frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times. In your scenario,
//you could cache information such as frequently used package tracking details, customer information, or courier routes.

//Session Management:
//Blazor apps often require session management for user authentication and maintaining user-specific data. Redis can be
//used to store session data, allowing for scalable and distributed session management across multiple instances of your
//application.

//Rate Limiting and Throttling:
//If your application interacts with external APIs or services for package tracking or other functionalities, Redis can
//help implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the rate of requests and prevent abuse.

//Background Jobs and Queues:
//Redis can be used as a message broker or queue for handling background jobs such as sending notifications, processing
//package updates, or scheduling tasks related to package delivery.

//Real-time Data Updates:
//If your application requires real-time updates for package tracking or status changes, Redis can be used as a pub/sub
//messaging system to distribute updates to connected clients in real-time.

//Consider evaluating your application's specific requirements and performance bottlenecks to determine the most suitable
//areas for Redis integration. Additionally, ensure proper error handling, monitoring, and scalability considerations
//when implementing Redis into your application architecture.
