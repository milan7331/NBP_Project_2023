what to do next:
1. implement some sort of messaging between the courier and app user (pub/sub or whatever (look at the chatgpt history))
2. implement redis caching on a wider scale
3. separate the neo4j db access layer from the controllers and implement a service for it.
4. flesh out the front end so it's an actual web app.
5. improve error handling (it doesn't exist rn).
